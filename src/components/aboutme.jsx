        My Name is Ash and I am 31 and I live in Maidstone in the UK. I am a creative person who enjoys making music, videos and now developing websites. I have been making music for 15 years now and I use Logic Pro to create my songs. I have recently graduated the Edx Front End Bootcamp which I gained a great understanding of different technologies and frameworks.
I want to bring my creativity to every project that I partake in and I enjoy seeing a project go from the drawing board to full deployment, below are the technologies I have used.
